# Strive exercises

## Today-I-Learned Summary:

### Day 1

-  concept of yield generator.
- 'with' keyword, very convenient, makes handling files much shorter
*with open(file, mode) as file_var*
- hash tables.
- always look deeper into methods to pay attention to complexity, as it's oftentimes not intuitive at first:
ex.: having to add-check a list of numbers of length *n*, a nested for loop algorithm makes *n* sums for *n* times, resulting in complexity of *O(n^{2})*. 
Sorting the list takes *nlogn*, so I can take advantage of it:

Overall complexity is now *nlogn + n - 1*

### Day 2 - 5

Overall programming basics I already know.

### Day 6

NumPy!! 

### Day 7
